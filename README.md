The main goal of this project is to detect anomalous behavior on devices by capturing and analyzing the RF emissions that are produced every time there is code running in their processors. These emissions cannot be manipulated or controlled, which makes them a truly reliable source when it comes to detect the state of a device. Both Program Counter(PC) and Instruction Register(IR) registers will be used to help characterize the device's behavior, more precisely the Hamming Distance(HD) of these two registers between instructions will be used as the connection between a certain instruction and its resulting emissions. To achieve this, firstly, it will be necessary to implement multiple behaviors in a device, at least one where the Program Counter is isolated, one where the Instruction Register is isolated, a normal one and a malicious/abnormal one. Then, using an RF probe, all the RF emissions resulting from executing these behaviors will be captured and will be analysed using signal processing and machine learning techniques. At the end, the system should be able to predict the correct HD of PC and IR and classify the state of the device as normal or not.
