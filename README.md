# Thesis

The main goal of this project is to detect anomalous behavior on devices by capturing and analyzing the RF emissions that are produced every time there is code running in their processors. These emissions cannot be manipulated or controlled, what makes them a truly reliable source when it comes to detect the state of a device. To achieve this, it will be necessary to implement multiple behaviors in multiple devices, both normal and malicious/abnormal. Then, using an RF probe, all the RF emissions resulting from executing these behaviors will be captured and will be analysed using signal processing and machine learning techniques.
